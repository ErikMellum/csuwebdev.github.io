# Chico State Web Dev and Design Club website [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/csuwebdev/csuwebdev.github.io.svg?branch=jekyll)](https://travis-ci.org/csuwebdev/csuwebdev.github.io)

This site is generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/csuwebdev/csuwebdev.github.io) for continuous integration and deployment. The master branch contains the built version of the site, and the jekyll branch contains the code.

## Site structure

### Posts and Collections

To add new content with Jekyll, you create a new file in the _posts folder. Content can be written in markdown or HTML. You can generate a new post by typing

````
$ rake new title="post title"
````
### SASS

The site includes the SASS version of Twitter Bootstrap. The _sass directory contains most of the files. They are imported by css/main.scss. This file will be compiled to CSS when the site is build.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/csuwebdev/csuwebdev.github.io/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)
3. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some feature')
4. Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)
5. Create a new Pull Request
