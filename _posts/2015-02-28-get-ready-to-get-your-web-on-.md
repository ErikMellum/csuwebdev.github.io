We will talk about git, open source, and how to fork, push, and pull request a git repository. This will go over some "must know" information if you ever do open source, and it is likely as an interview question! Very useful and please show up if you are a member!

Mark it on your calendars. This is a good one meant for those who want to build personal or professional websites. We will go over very useful information and tools such as gulp, bower, bootstrap, and sublime text which will increase the quality and speed of your web development regardless of language or tools. Perfect for beginners and advanced alike!

##The AWS setup and UPE Game Night / Lan party were awesome
* We had probably ~20 people at the AWS event last Saturday and it was great! Everyone was able to get a web server running through AWS! Maybe we can start an aggregate list of member websites!
* At the Lan Party last night put on by UPE, Web, and ACM club there were ~50 people! There was super smash brothers, halo, and tons of board games and pizza.
* If you weren't able to make it those (or you were) be sure to check out the next event and meeting!
